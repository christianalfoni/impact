# Teamwork

Working on features is best done in cross functional teams. Product, design and engineering meets as equal partners solving a problem. With a common goal the team decides how to best approach it and measure its success. As design and UX suggestions are produced, the discussion starts pivoting towards implementation. In the client all user experience is split between user interface and state management.

Regardless of your team working as a cross functional team, Impact can help you be more productive implementing complicated features. By approaching implementations split between state management and user interface, two engineers can look at the same designs and derive two different implementations:

1. What components do I need from our design system and how will I compose them
2. What state management is required for this user experience to work

Both engineers can work on implementing the feature where the 1st engineer works more closely with the designer to iterate and the 2nd engineer works more closely with the backend engineer(s) to iterate.

Like all implementations there will be changes, but now the user interface can change implementation without affecting state management and the state management can change implementation without affecting the user interface. At times user interface changes does affect the rest of the stack and the other way around, but that is why you are a cross functional team with a common goal... right? ;-)
