# Context

With a React context, we can overcome both challenges we experienced passing props in the [previous chapter](./props). By providing a context, we can consume state and related management in any nested component.

```tsx
import { useState, createContext, useCallback, useMemo } from "react";
import { App } from "./App";

const appContext = createContext();

export default function AppContextProvider({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increase = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((current) => current + 1);
  }, []);

  const app = useMemo(
    () => ({
      count,
      increase,
    }),
    [count, increase],
  );

  return <appContext.Provider value={app}>{children}</appContext.Provider>;
}
```

The `app` will now be consumable directly in any nested component. That is great, but it will introduce a new set of challenges:

1. The context provider will reconcile unrelated to actual changes in the context. We need to use memoizing hooks to ensure that reconciliation of the context provider does not change the reference of the context unnecessarily, or all components consuming the context will also reconcile.
2. When the context actually changes reference (due to a state change) all consumers of the context will reconcile. That means React contexts are an "all or nothing" deal. Components consuming the context will reconcile on any change of the context, not by the state they actually consume from it.
3. The component as a function is an amazing concept. It makes a lot of sense to think of UIs as `(state) => ui`. Calling the function with updated state will update the UI. This is what React's reconciler enables. When hooks were introduced, the reconciler could also manage state within the function itself, allowing us to fully embrace the function component. Hooks are the most elegant way to introduce state management with a reconciler, but a reconciler is not something you would introduce to make state management more performant or accessible in and of itself.

Even though the new [React Compiler](https://react.dev/blog/2024/02/15/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-february-2024#react-compiler) can solve the first topic above, it does not solve the others.
