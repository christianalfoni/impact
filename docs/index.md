  - title: Performant and accessible
    details: Reactive primitives are more performant and enables an accessible developer experience with automatic observation in components.
  - title: Next state stores
    details: Instead of leaving context and going global, take advantage of nested stores and handle state dependencies like a champ.

## Presenting Impact

> **Impact** is born from the experience of building rich complex productivity applications. Their complexity is not primarily in data fetching, but managing a dynamic and highly interactive user interface on the client. Reactive primitives has helped us solve performance challenges while keeping us sane expressing all this complexity. At the same time these reactive primitives have forced us out of React and into a global scope. With **Impact** you can use the reactive primitives you know and love and replace the reconciling state management in React with intuitive and performant primitives.

If you have used Impact in an application or you think it has valuable perspectives or concepts for a discussion, please use the [Template Slides Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pHBW-HxkugtK8Ny1ebj3a_klqu3HzHnSPvbVNw1drnU/edit?usp=sharing). Present Impact at your company, a local meetup or at a conference. Please reach out if you have any questions or think the slide deck should be updated.

::: info

All functions that has a nested call to a hook that ends with the name `Store` will be wrapped in the related `observer`. That means all your store hooks needs to end with `Store`, for example `useAppStore` or `useGlobalStore`.
