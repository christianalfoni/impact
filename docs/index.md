features:
  - title: The best of both worlds
    details: Use Impacts observation model to manage state. Use Reacts reconciliation model to manage UI.
  - title: Performant and predictable
    details: Primitives of signal, derived and effect, combined with automatic observation in components.
  - title: A bridge between reconciliation and observation
    details: Makes reconciling values into signals in stores and signals into reconciling values in components.

## Presentation

[üçø Watch Impact presentation üçø](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QHn8LVlPYE)

If you have used Impact in an application or you think it has valuable perspectives or concepts for a discussion, please use the [Template Slides Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pHBW-HxkugtK8Ny1ebj3a_klqu3HzHnSPvbVNw1drnU/edit?usp=sharing). Present Impact at your company, a local meetup or at a conference. Please reach out if you have any questions or think the slide deck should be updated.

## Install impact-react

```sh
npm install impact-react
```

::: warning

Impact requires Explicit Resource Management which is currently a Stage 3 proposal. It works out of the box with latest TypeScript, SWC and ESBuild. Implementations in browsers is on its way. Babel currently requires a [plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-proposal-explicit-resource-management).

:::

## Install debugger

The Debugger will show you what signals and effects are being executed. With sourcemaps you'll see the exact point in the file where signals are changed.

```sh
npm install impact-react-debugger
```

```ts
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  import("impact-react-debugger");
}
```

::: tip

Hit SHIFT twice to toggle the debugger
