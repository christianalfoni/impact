If you have used Impact in an application or you think it has valuable perspectives or concepts for a discussion, please use the [Template Slides Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pHBW-HxkugtK8Ny1ebj3a_klqu3HzHnSPvbVNw1drnU/edit?usp=sharing). Present Impact at your company, a local meetup or at a conference. Please reach out if you have any questions or think the slide deck should be updated.

  import("impact-react-debugger");
}
```
